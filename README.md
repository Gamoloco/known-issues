# Gamoloco - Known Issues

Just like everyone else, we have issues at Gamoloco. 

To keep you informed about them, we have started a list : https://github.com/Gamoloco/known-issues/issues. We'll keep it updated as we make progress on fixing those or add new ones.

**Gamoloco Needs You**

Fortunately this list isn't too big, especially when you consider **we have aggregated data for 16 millions channels in our daily scoreboards** only. But in all truth, there might be other issues on top of this list, ones that we haven't found out about yet. I'm thinking specifically about data-related ones such as unexplained spikes or missing entries, but it could also be random bugs. 

If you browse Gamoloco on a regular basis and notice something that looks strange, please give us a hand by letting us know! You could [do it directly here](https://github.com/Gamoloco/known-issues/issues) if you have a Github account. We have also have a [contact page](https://www.gamoloco.com/contact) you could you use, if that's more convenient.
