# Gamoloco - Known Issues

Just like everyone else, we have issues at Gamoloco. Some we'll be able to fix, but it will take some time, and some we won't be able to.

To keep you informed about those issues, we have started a list : https://github.com/Gamoloco/known-issues/issues. We'll keep it updated as we make progress on fixing those or add new ones.

**Gamoloco Needs You**

Fortunately this list isn't too big, especially when you consider **we have aggregated data for 16 millions channels in our daily scoreboards** only. But in all truth, there might be other issues on top of this list, ones that we haven't found out about yet. I'm thinking specifically about data-related ones such as unexplained spikes or missing entries, but it could also be random bugs. 

If you browse Gamoloco on a regular basis and notice something that looks strange, please give us a hand by letting us know! You could [do it directly here](https://github.com/Gamoloco/known-issues/issues) if you have an account there. We have also started a [Reddit thread about known issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamoloco/comments/498bl9/gamolocos_list_of_known_issues/) if that's more convenient for you to contribute.
